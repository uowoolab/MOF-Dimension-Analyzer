# MOF-Dimension-Analyzer
This repository contains a tool for calculating the dimensionality of MOFs from CIF files. Based on an earlier CSD version (created by S.B. Wiggin, CCDC, 2020-01-21), this version is updated to directly process CIF files and supports parallel execution for handling larger datasets more efficiently.
